## What to Know Before Adding Me (DNI / Thin Ice List)

I prefer not to engage with people who are:

- Anti-capitalist or who don’t respect my views on capitalism  
- Against transgender identities or transgender rights  
- Supporters of AI-generated “art” (I’m anti-AI art)  
- Proponents of pseudosciences, especially typology misuses  
- Homophobic, racist, ableist, or toxic in any way  
- Fans of drama or disingenuous fandom behavior  

If you resonate with these, please respect my boundaries and don’t add me.
